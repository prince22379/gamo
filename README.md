Title: "Stick Hero"

Description:
"Stick Extender" is an engaging and innovative 2D platformer game where players control a character equipped with a magical extending stick. The objective is to cross various challenging bridges suspended in the sky, filled with gaps and obstacles. The twist lies in the player's ability to elongate the stick by pressing a designated key.

As players navigate through each level, they encounter platforms, moving obstacles, and treacherous gaps. To successfully cross these obstacles, players must strategically time and press the key to extend the stick, reaching distant platforms and creating makeshift bridges. The longer the stick, the easier it becomes to bridge gaps and overcome hurdles.

The game features a mix of precision timing, reflexes, and strategic thinking as players explore vibrant and visually appealing landscapes. Each level presents new challenges, requiring players to adapt their stick length to various scenarios. Some levels may introduce physics-based puzzles, where the length of the stick affects the balance of structures or activates mechanisms.

Players can earn points or rewards based on their performance, encouraging them to experiment with different stick lengths and find the optimal strategy for each level. The game's intuitive controls and progressively challenging levels make it suitable for players of all skill levels, providing a fun and rewarding experience.

"Stick Extender" offers a unique twist on the traditional platformer genre, encouraging creativity and problem-solving while providing an entertaining and visually captivating gaming experience.
